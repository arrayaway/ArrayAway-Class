						<h4>1. Does Your Wampserver Work?</h4>
						<div class="alert alert-info">
							<strong>Part 1:</strong> Make sure you have downloaded Wampserver if you are on a windows machine. 
							If you are running some form of linux, get XAMPP: <a href="https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html" target="_blank">https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html</a>
						</div>
						<div class="alert alert-info">
							<strong>Part 2:</strong> Get refreshed on WAMPserver (or XAMPP) a bit. This video shows the 
							common mechanics of wampserver: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qku0ppy-lUU" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qku0ppy-lUU</a>
							or just check out this site: <a href="https://www.homeandlearn.co.uk/php/php1p3.html" target="_blank">https://www.homeandlearn.co.uk/php/php1p3.html</a>
						</div>
						<div class="alert alert-info">
							<strong>Part 3:</strong> Create a new directory in the www folder of your wampserver called "Homework."
							The www folder of your wampserver should be C:\wamp64\www or C:\wamp32\www. You can find this easy
							by running WAMPserver, clicking on its W icon on the bottom right of your screen, and clicking the 
							"www directory" piece. 
						</div>
						<div class="alert alert-info">
							<strong>Part 4:</strong> Copy the file that came with this homework, index.php, and paste it into 
							the new folder you created in the www directory of WAMPserver. 
						</div>
						<div class="alert alert-info">
							<strong>Part 5:</strong> Make sure that WAMPserver is on by checking to see if the W icon is yellow or green.
							If it is red, click the icon. If there is no icon at the bottom right of your screen, check in the up arrow to 
							see if it is hiding. If it is not there, then you need to find WAMPserver and run it. Chances are
							when you installed wampserver, it created a desktop icon that you can use as a shortcut. Try that.
						</div>
						<div class="alert alert-info">
							<strong>Part 6:</strong> With Wampserver running, open a browser, and put 
							http://localhost/Homework/ in the URL bar and enter. You should see "I WORKED!!!!!!". 
						</div>

						<h4>2. Import header and footer files</h4>
						<div class="alert alert-info">
							<strong>Part 1:</strong> Make sure to familiarize yourself with PHP's include function:
							<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_includes.asp"
												target="_blank">https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_includes.asp</a>
						</div>
						<div class="alert alert-info">
							<strong>Part 2:</strong> Copy the file that came with this homework, header.php, and paste it into 
							the Homework folder you created in the www directory of WAMPserver. 
						</div>
						<div class="alert alert-info">
							<strong>Part 3:</strong> Copy the file that came with this homework, footer.php, and paste it into 
							the Homework folder you created in the www directory of WAMPserver. 
						</div>
						<div class="alert alert-info">
							<strong>Part 4:</strong> From the first homework chunk, you should have pasted an index.php file in the 
							Homework directory. This file is the file I am referring to when I say edit the index.php file.
						</div>
						<div class="alert alert-info">
							<strong>Part 5:</strong> Edit the index.php file to include the header.php file using include("header.php");
						</div>
						<div class="alert alert-info">
							<strong>Part 6:</strong> Edit the index.php file to include the footer.php file using include again but with the footer file's
							name given to the function.
						</div>
						<div class="alert alert-info">
							<strong>Part 7:</strong> At this point, all of the html in index.php should and can be removed, since header includes everything
							needed for the basic html stuffs and footer closes out the body and html tags. 
						</div>
						<div class="alert alert-info">
							<strong>Part 8:</strong> At this point, all of the html in index.php should and can be removed, since header includes everything
							needed for the basic html stuffs and footer closes out the body and html tags. 
						</div>
						<div class="alert alert-info">
							<strong>Part 9:</strong> Create a new file in the Homework directory called "contact.php"
						</div>
						<div class="alert alert-info">
							<strong>Part 10:</strong> Copy the code in index.php and paste it into contact.php.
						</div>
						<div class="alert alert-info">
							<strong>Part 11:</strong> Make the echo that is saying "I WORKED!!!!!!" write something that would make see for
							the index page in index.php like "Welcome to my website!" and then make the same echo in the contact.php file
							write something that makes since for a contact page like "Please contact the law offices of ponies and candy 
							for further information."
						</div>
						<div class="alert alert-warning">
							<strong>Note:</strong> before php (and javascript and other languages can do this include mechanic as well),
							this situation would be handled by copying and pasting the header and footer html code into 
							every page file the website had i.e. the home, contact, about us, store, etc. Whenever a change was made to the 
							header portion like say the navbar got a new link, that change needed to be made in each of the 
							page files, which is very tedious. We can just edit the one header.php file!
						</div>
						<div class="alert alert-info">
							<strong>Part 12:</strong> Make the navbar link between the index.php and the contact.php page by modifying 
							the nav bar items. Make one of the items "Home" and set its href to index.php. Make another one "Contact Us"
							and set its href to contact.php.
